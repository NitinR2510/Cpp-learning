 learning C++ during lockdown
 
 **I did know about iostream but** <br> 
 The following are the possible input/output libraries in cpp
 <ul>
 <li>
 iostream: iostream stands for standard input output stream. This header file contains definitions to objects like cin, cout, cerr etc.
 </li>
 <li>
iomanip: iomanip stands for input output manipulators. The methods declared in this files are used for manipulating streams. This file contains definitions of setw, setprecision etc.</li>
 <li>
fstream: This header file mainly describes the file stream. This header file is used to handle the data being read from a file as input or data being written into the file as output.</li>
 
 **Topics covered**
 <ol type="i">
 <li>Compiler, about Cpp, Input/Output</li>
 <li>Variables-1</li>
 <li>Variables-2</li>
 <li>Operators</li>

 ## Extra-notes
**Errors in cpp**
<ul>
 <li>Syntax error</li>
 <li>Logical error</li>
  <li>Semantic error</li>
  <li>Runtime error</li>
  <li>Runtime error</li>
  <li>Liker error</li>
</ul>

**Operators**
<ul>
 <li>Binary Operators:
  <ul>
   <li>Addition +</li>
   <li>subtraction - </li>
   <li>modular division % </li>
   <li>multiplication *</li>
   <li>Division / </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Unary Operator
  <ul>
   <li> increment (x++ or ++x)Also known as postfix increment or prefix increment<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> y = x ++ is <br> y=x<br>x=x+1 <br> <i>and vice versa...</i>
    <br> It is not recommended to use multiple unary operators in the same line.
   </li>
   <li> decrement -- </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>
 
 **Note** 
 The precedence of associativity is left to right in addition, subtraction etc. However for assignment operator it is right to left.<br>
 Which is pretty clear actually if one sees the way in which variables are assigned values in C++.
